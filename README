In honour of International Talk Like A Pirate Day, this module generates
piratical insults.  It can also generate insults in any other language
by using pluggable back-ends.

This is an insult generator.  It generates insults.  It says rude things
even if you don't use it properly.  Humourless prudes may prefer Acme::Pony.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
